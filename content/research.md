 My **research line** is Choice Modeling applied to transportation demand, travel behavior, time-use and activities, and sustainable mobility. My main affiliation is [Universidad de Concepción](https://fi.udec.cl/), but I am also part of the [Complex Engineering Systems Institute](https://isci.cl/en/) and the [Centre for Sustainable Urban Development](https://en.cedeus.cl/). The research conferences I usually try to attend are the [Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board](https://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx), the [International Choice Modelling Conference](https://www.icmconference.org.uk/), the [International Conference for Travel Behaviour Research](https://www.icmconference.org.uk/), and the [Congreso Chileno de Ingeniería de Transporte](https://sochitran.cl/).

You can see the details of my research on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeThwLMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/3881761) profiles, using the name **Sebastian Astroza**. When I was a master student I decided to drop the accent mark of my first name (Sebastián) and my second last name (Tagle) for my “author name”, thinking that would be easier for everyone. I am unsure if I would do that now, but I guess it is too late. What is life anyway? A series of regretful decisions, one after another.
