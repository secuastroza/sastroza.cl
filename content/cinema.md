One of my hobbies is collecting movies (physical media). I have hundreds of DVDs and Blurays. Since I'm obsessive, I have this [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KxzIZF85vcm4fmN1Ep0TReR46NigUAEj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115543448429602200561&rtpof=true&sd=true) where I keep track of what I have (and who I lend them to if that strange event occurs in which I consider you worthy of borrowing one of my movies). I like to talk about cinema; I always use something related in class as an example. Here, you can find a list of movies that I highly recommend.

## Paris, Texas (Win Wenders, 1984)
![Paris Texas](/img/wenders2.JPG)

Master piece about losing, finding, laughing, crying, screaming, staying silent, forgetting, and remembering. You know, life.

## La Jetée | Sans Soleil (Chris Marker, 1962|1983)
![La Jetee and Sans Soleil](/img/marker.JPG)
Two films about two images that contain all the other images that exist in the world.

## Rosetta (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, 1999)
![Rosetta](/img/dardenne.JPG)
The proletariat's struggle is filmed like a war movie, with much more in our imagination than what is actually shown on camera.

## Yi Yi: A one and a two (Edward Yang, 2000)
![YiYi](/img/yang.JPG)
This warm and at the same time dramatic film takes on different dimensions as you grow as a person.

## Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966)
![Persona](/img/bergman.JPG)
We think that our favorite movies are windows to fascinating worlds. But the best are the ones that end up being a mirror: they allow us to see as much as we are.

## Three Colors Trilogy (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1993-1994)
![Three Colors Trilogy](/img/kies.JPG)
Mindblowing films. Three reasons why I love cinema so much.

## Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Céline Sciamma, 2019)
![Portrait of a Lady on Fire](/img/sciamma.JPG)
Some movies are deep. Not everything is fleeting.

<!--
## El otro día (Ignacio Agüero, 2012)

## Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcok, 1958)
![Vertigo](/img/hitch.JPG)

From 1958 onwards, all films are nothing more than remakes of Vertigo.

## Vagabond (Anges Varda, 1985)
![Vagabond](/img/varda.PNG)

Perfectly devastating.

## A Woman Under the Influence (John Cassavetes, 1974)
![A Woman Under the Influence](/img/cassa.JPG)
A film that breaks all the rules and makes every shot so real that it looks like a dream.

## Mauvais Sang (Leos Carax, 1984)
![Mauvais Sang](/img/carax.JPG)

Coolest movie ever made.

<!--
## No Intenso Agora (João Moreira Salles, 2017)

## Misterios de Lisboa (Raúl Ruiz, 2011)
![Misterios de Lisboa](/img/ruiz.JPG)

My favorite movie from the greatest director/author we (chileans) ever had.

## Inside Llewyn Davis (Ethan and Joel Coen, 2013)
![Inside Llewyn Davis](/img/coen.JPG)

Borges, Cortázar, and Bolaño walk into a bar and start writing a musical.

Best remake of Vertigo ever made.

## Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (Jacques Demy, 1964)
![Les Parapluis de Cherbourg](/img/demy.JPEG)

Favorite musical (and I really love musicals)

## Blow Out (De Palma, 1981)
![Blow Out](/img/depalma.JPG)

It's a good scream.

## Histoire(s) du Cinéma (Jean-Luc Godard, 1988)
![Histoire du Cinema](/img/godard.JPG)

“Cinema substitutes for our gaze a world corresponding to our desires”
